# Introduction
For project it was required to create, test, and deploy, a proof of concept data-driven full stack web-application so I wanted to do something that would make sense for me.
I decided to go with a game that is played around the globe and that includes me, Animal Crossing New Horizons for Nintendo Switch.
Animal Crossing has around 240 000 players online daily and has sold around 40 million dollars since its release making it one of the most successful games for the console.
While playing the game, there was always something that bothered me, *fishing*! I never know if the fish I just got was worth the space in the inventory or if I could just throw it out and keep the good ones (£££) to sell later and the only way to find out is going to the store and try to sell them, but even then, I would have to sell them individually to know their exact price.
In the end of the day the same problems remained:
-	I can’t know the price while fishing
-	I have to go to the store and them sell individually to see the price
-	I can’t remember the price later
-	I make low money due to carrying worthless fish
There must be a better way!
Using the animal crossing new horizons’ s dataset from Kaggle.com I created a web-app that allows players to check fish prices while they are fishing so they know if it is worth to keep them.
